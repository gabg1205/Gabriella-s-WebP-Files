I created this website for my first assignment in Web Production, and I share some facts about me. I want to learn how to make a more elaborate website, but I don't know how just yet, so I'm looking forward to delving into the resources Professor Li provided. I used Professor Li's code from last Wednesday as an outline for my website, just to learn the basic html elements. file:///Users/gabg0524/Desktop/Web-productions/webpsite.html
